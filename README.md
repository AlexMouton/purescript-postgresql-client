# purescript-postgresql-client

purescript-postgresql-client is a PostgreSQL client library for PureScript.

To use this library, you need to add `pg` as an npm dependency.

`pg` being the npm repo of https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres 

The purspgpp preprocessor has been replaced by [sqltopurs], which is a code
generator instead of a preprocessor, and easier to use.
